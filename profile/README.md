The NOAA's Historical Hurricane Tracks website offers an interactive platform that allows users to explore the paths of historical hurricanes. It provides detailed information on the trajectories, intensity, and impact of tropical cyclones and hurricanes over the years. This resource is invaluable for researchers, planners, and the general public interested in understanding hurricane patterns and their potential effects on different regions.
